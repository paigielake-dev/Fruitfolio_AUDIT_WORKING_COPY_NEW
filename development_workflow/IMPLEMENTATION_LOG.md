# Implementation log

## P1-modal-accessibility

- Recovered clean branch development/prompt-1b-complete from defa3c9; preserved existing app, artwork, research and resources.
- Preserved original source materials and all 478 checklist descriptions/printed IDs. Added checkpoint, evidence register and recovery protocol.
- Shared modal modifier now removes blocked background content from the accessibility tree. The existing hit-testing block remains active. Reduce Motion uses identity scale, retaining the existing short blur transition.
- Added Swift unit coverage for all four active/Reduce Motion combinations in FounderOverrideIntegrationTests. Swift/Xcode execution pending on macOS.
- Requirements: Part 1 sequences 1–6 and 70 remain IN_PROGRESS; broad visual/accessibility requirements are not marked complete.
- Commit: containing commit, batch P1-modal-accessibility. See Git history for authoritative SHA.
- Executed workflow integrity: 2 passed; Mac script syntax and diff whitespace checks passed. These do not establish iOS behavior.

## P1-popup-dismissal-ownership

- Previous checkpoint: 56723585e21a11416b22ce753b3743967e7f2cc8.
- Part 1 sequence 6: delayed host completion now captures popup UUID and coordinator rejects stale completions or non-dismissing states. Task cancellation exits without clearing a popup.
- Added regression tests covering a replacement that is itself dismissing and an attempted completion of a still-visible popup.
- Executed Python workflow tests: 2 passed. Diff check passed. Swift tests NOT_RUN; macOS verification script includes the affected suite.
- Removed a generated Python bytecode file accidentally included in the first checkpoint; added workflow ignore rules.
- Commit: containing commit, P1-popup-dismissal-ownership.

## P1-canonical-watercolor-controls

- Previous checkpoint: 00818937eb837d50ba905864584c0d0a07c34f20.
- Part 1 sequences 7–12: primary/secondary compatibility controls now use existing canonical pill artwork, shared pop animation, synchronous action and audio. Cycle onboarding callers inherit the change. Full app-wide control migration remains pending.
- Canonical pill labels have no line limit or font shrinking; height follows wrapped content, with resizable image-center regions preserving painted edges. Device visual inspection pending.
- Added UIHostingController sizing regression for a long label at accessibility3. NOT_RUN on Linux; added suite to Mac script.
- Python workflow tests: 2 passed. Shell syntax and whitespace checks passed. No iOS runtime claims.
- Commit: containing commit, P1-canonical-watercolor-controls.

## P1-scrollable-character-dialogue

- Previous checkpoint: 02e08666bfa46976777e92a2e3c0b7910e419b5c.
- Part 1 sequences 18–26 (selected related entries) remain IN_PROGRESS. Character dialogue scrolls inside the existing artwork writing area. Short content retains vertical centering. Labels wrap, scale with Dynamic Type and use minimum 44-point targets.
- Added stable scroll/action accessibility identifiers and a DEBUG-only isolated modal regression route; it does not read/write user data or enable itself in release.
- Added UI tests asserting hidden background, reachable long-content dismissal, restoration, Reduce Motion/accessibility size, and screenshot attachments. They have NOT_RUN here.
- Executed workflow tests: 2 passed; shell syntax and whitespace checks passed. Mac runner exits 2 with explicit missing-Xcode diagnostic.
- Founder binary specification preserved, but antiword download failed because distro package indexes do not list it. Full-text extraction remains pending; no content invented.
- Commit: containing commit, P1-scrollable-character-dialogue.
