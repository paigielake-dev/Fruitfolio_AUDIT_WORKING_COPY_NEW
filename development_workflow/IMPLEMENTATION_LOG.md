# Implementation log

## P1-modal-accessibility

- Recovered clean branch development/prompt-1b-complete from defa3c9; preserved existing app, artwork, research and resources.
- Preserved original source materials and all 478 checklist descriptions/printed IDs. Added checkpoint, evidence register and recovery protocol.
- Shared modal modifier now removes blocked background content from the accessibility tree. The existing hit-testing block remains active. Reduce Motion uses identity scale, retaining the existing short blur transition.
- Added Swift unit coverage for all four active/Reduce Motion combinations in FounderOverrideIntegrationTests. Swift/Xcode execution pending on macOS.
- Requirements: Part 1 sequences 1–6 and 70 remain IN_PROGRESS; broad visual/accessibility requirements are not marked complete.
- Commit: containing commit, batch P1-modal-accessibility. See Git history for authoritative SHA.
- Executed workflow integrity: 2 passed; Mac script syntax and diff whitespace checks passed. These do not establish iOS behavior.
